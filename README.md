# Imaginarium Theater Character Counter
This app is meant to help free-to-play (F2P) players see if they meet the character count requirements for each tier of the Imaginarium Theater.

[What is Imaginarium Theater?](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Imaginarium_Theater)

Each season, the number of eligible characters each player has varies. Thus, it is paramount to plan ahead and pick the right characters to avoid being locked out of an Imaginarium Theater stage.



## Counting Characters
Characters are counted in 3 steps:
- Alternate Cast Elements
- Special Invitations
- Opening Characters

### Alternate Cast Elements
Each season, there are 3 alternate cast elements. Characters of these elements can generally be used in the season. Since the 3 elements rotate every season, it is generally a good idea to ensure that you don't have too few characters in a particular element.

### Special Invitations
Next, there will be 4 Special Invitation characters. These characters are guaranteed to have elements _**outside**_ of the alternate cast elements mentioned above. However, they can be used **only if a player has them**.

### Opening Characters
Next, there will be 6 opening characters. These characters are guaranteed to have elements matching the alternate cast elements mentioned above. In addition, they are available for everyone to use, **even if a player doesn't have them**.

Thus, it is better for a player _**not**_ to have the opening characters as the overlap doesn't help increase their character count.

### Putting it all together

The general formula for counting is as follows:
1. **Count** the number of characters you have with any of the 3 alternate cast elements
2. **Add** the number of characters you have matching the 4 special invitation characters
3. **Subtract** the number of characters you have matching the 6 opening characters

The final number of characters you have is then compared against the table below:

| Difficulty | Eligible Character Count Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Easy | 8 |
| Normal | 12 |
| Hard | 16 |
| Visionary | 22 |

For example, a player must have 16 eligible characters to be able to play Hard mode on Imaginarium Theater.

_Note that prior to September 2024, there was no visionary tier, and the difficulty requirements for Easy, Normal, Hard were 10, 14, 18 respectively._
